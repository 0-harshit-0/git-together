Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights upon the creator and subsequent owner(s)
of an original work of authorship and or a database. Certain owners wish to
permanently relinquish those rights to a work for the purpose of contributing to
a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works that the public can
reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify,
incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
purposes. These owners may contribute to the commons to promote the ideal of a
free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their work in part
through the use and efforts of others.

For these and or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a work
a CC0 Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, abandons, and surrenders all of the Affirmer's Copyright and Related
Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
including existing as well as future claims and causes of action, in the work
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

The work is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the Affirmer be liable
for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation direct, indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, arising out of or in
connection with the use of the work.
