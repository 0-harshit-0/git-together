# Git Together
We fork, we PR, we agree, or we don't.


## The 3-way handshake

> Connection only happens if all three steps succeed.

1. Fork
You signal availability.
2. Pull Request
You express intent.
_The PR description is the payload._
3. Approve and Merge
Mutual consent.
_No approval, no merge, no connection._

*Anything else is just noise.*


## Mapping GitHub to humans

- Fork = I am open
- Branch = current mood or intent
- PR = approach
- Review comment = response
- Approval = interested
- Merge = agreement
- Close PR = no
- Revert = rejected!!!
- Force push = illegal, DON'T DO THIS
- Commit history = history


## KISS

- No fork means no interest.
- No PR means no move.
- No approval means no consent.
- No merge without all approvals.
- Silence is a valid response.
- Closed PRs are final.
- Reverts are allowed.
- Screenshots of commits are fair game.
- Personal info stays out of GitHub.
- If someone says stop, stop immediately.


## Allowed states

- Loving
- Kinky
- Curious
- Fake
- Roleplay
- Irony
- Chaos
- Sincerity

> [!TIP]
> All allowed as long as:
> - consent is explicit
> - exits are respected

_Optional. Removable. No obligation._

## What this system optimizes for

- Clear signals over vibes
- Explicit consent over assumptions
- Public state over private pressure
- Easy exits over forced continuity
- Failure modes
- Ghosting is just a PR with no review.
- Rejection is a closed PR.
- Breakups are clean reverts.
- Drama is just bad branch management.


## Governance

- Repo owners act as maintainers.
- Maintainers can close, lock, or revert any PR.
- If the system stops being fun, it gets deprecated.


## Final invariant

- If it is not approved, it is not merged.
- If it is not merged, it did not happen.


Commit responsibly.
